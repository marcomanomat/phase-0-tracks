How I intend to tackle jQuery
+ Look up differnt beginner definitions of jQuery

+ Search for a couple of cheat sheets that pull some of the bigger concepts that I'll need to use

+ Here I'll test my knowledge to see if I can do anyting jQuery on my own

+Search via google or reddit, some tutorials and challenges to refine my understanding of jQuery

+ Test my knowledge again.

+ If confident, I'll try to make a small jQuery project.

Things that worked, and did not
+ Looking up begginer definitions gave me to intuition on how jQuery would work. I tweeked it to "introduction" instead of begginers guide, because it seemed to give me more definitions over practice problems.

+ This didn't work as well as I thought it would, because I don't think my understanding of jQuery is strong enough yet. This would be better after 7 I think.

+This worked well in letting me know I didn't learn anything yet, should have done 5 first.


+ This worked well, I like the learnprogramming subreddit, I feel it's a little less prior knowledge then slackoverflow.

+ I was a bit better at jQuery, and was able to make a fade in/out for 7.
