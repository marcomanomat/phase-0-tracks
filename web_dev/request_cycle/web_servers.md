In your own words, what is a VPS (virtual private server)? What, according to your research, are the advantages of using a VPS?

+ A VPS (aka virtual dedicated server) is a computer that users can use as a server for their website(s). The difference between this and a dedicated server is that a VPS is a virtual server, meaning that it's shared by many different people instead of a server that is just dedicated to one person. Also, VPSs have their own operating system, disc space, and bandwidth, unlike a shared web hoster's servers, which is shared by other users renting the server. DigitalOcean is an example of a VPS hosting service.

+ Advantages: more stable in comparison to a shared web host server (prevents server crashes from users on the same server), control over your environment without having to contact host provider, environmentally friendly (many people share server), and memory can be upgraded or downgraded to serve different amounts of traffic without major issues or downtime.

Bonus: Why is it considered a bad idea to run programs as the root user on a Linux system?
