Release 0: Equip Your New Robot
It's the year 2030, and you've finally acquired a Personal Robot to do your bidding. Huzzah!

Unfortunately, your robot doesn't know how to use an elevator.

Write the algorithm for using an elevator. Remember, robots are not smart at all, so you'll have to spell everything out.

For instance, how will your robot figure out which floor button to press?

Outside of the elevator:
- The robot asks if I want to go up or down.
  -If I say UP, it presses the UP button
  -Or if I say DOWN, it presses the DOWN button.

Once it sees the elevator door open, it walks inside. 
While inside the elevator:

- I tell the robot that the door is closed.
   - When it hears this, the robot asks me “what floor number?” 
   - Depending on the number I say, the robot will now press the button associated with that number.
   - When it sees the door open, the robot now walks out of the elevator.



Release 1: Find a Real-Life Algorithm
You're a smart human, not a dumb computer. That means you likely follow algorithms on a daily basis without even knowing it, taking your astonishing abilities completely for granted.

Come up with an example of a common task in your life that could be translated into an algorithm, and write out the steps in algorithms.txt (labeled with the name of the task).

TASK - “Putting on a Shirt - Correctly”

- hold shirt
- make sure tag is inside shirt (not outside of it)
  - if tag is outside, manipulate the shirt until tag is inside
- find biggest hole in shirt
- put your head inside the biggest hole of the shirt
- then put your head inside the second biggest hole of the shirt
- make sure tag is now located behind you
  - if tag is in front of you, manipulate shirt (while with head inside both the biggest hole, and second hole still) until it is behind you
- put your right arm thru the biggest hole, and find the 3rd smallest hole, that is closest to your right side, and put it in that hole
- put your left arm thru the biggest hole, and find the 3rd smallest hole, that is closest to the left side, and put it in that hole
