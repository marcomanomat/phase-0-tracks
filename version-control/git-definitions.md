# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
-Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
-Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
-Committing adds your changes to the history of your repository and assigns a commit name to it. A good commit message is detailed and states what was changed since the last commit.

* What is a merge conflict?
-If Git has any problems or doubts when merging, it will try to merge automatically as much as it can and then will report the list of all merge conflicts it has found and couldnâ€™t resolve by itself.
